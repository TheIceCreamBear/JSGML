# JSGML - JavaScript Graphics Math Library
A JavaScript Math Library for graphics. 

## Purpose
When doing 3D graphics, the math library you use can determine the direction and architecture of your project. The goal of this library is to create a math library that does not get in your way, and allows you to utilize it in a way that helps you most.

Now why not using something that already exists? I personally believe, and this is *entirely* subjective, most other libraries do not always contain what you need, or are written in a way that makes them hard to use in some cases. This library attempt to solve this.

## Usage
To use, install with npm. For usage on the web, use your packaging library of choice (eg. webpack or gulp).
```
npm install jsgml
```

## Contributing
